This repo is to pull together some visual experiments from a couple of years ago into a triptych/canvas projection mapping context, and to see where it goes from there.

The patches run in vvvv45beta27.2, which as of this writing can be [downloaded here](http://vvvv.org/blog/vvvv45beta27.2). I haven't tested them with newer software yet.

Make sure you also install the [addon pack](http://vvvv.org/blog/addons45beta27.201).
